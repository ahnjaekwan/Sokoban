# Sokoban
Sokoban is a puzzle game which the player pushes all boxes in predefined goal positions in the fewest number of moves.

Spec is given in pdf format in this repository.

Notes:

1. I applied the A* search algorithm with admissible and efficient heuristic function that I created.
2. I advanced the efficiency of the program by applying forward checking to foresee and prevent bad moves.
